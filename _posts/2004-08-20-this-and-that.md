A lot of things have happened since the last entry including a trip to [Argentina](http://sumit-old.tampahost.net/photos/argentina) and the MobileCam you see on the right. The picture was taken with a Sony Ericsson T616 and transferred to this page without any user intervention. Source code and instructions to setup your own MobileCam coming soon&#8230;
