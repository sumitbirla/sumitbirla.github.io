  Spend two good weeks in India covering Hyderabad, Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. It was great fun to be on the road again after such a long time. My last trip was to Argentina in 2004. The year 2005 went by too fast! I finally got to see the Taj Mahal in all its glory. Now it is back to the usual routine &#8211; work, work, sleep, eat etc.
