Here is a recording of my desktop running Ubuntu. Notice how much cooler it is than yours (if you run Windows) :). Apart from eye-candy, the UI is extremely clean and functional. The animation was recorded on my cheapo laptop with a pathetic graphics chip. If you want to see the true potential of this system, head over to YouTube to see some movies others have made. Search for keywords &#8216;compiz&#8217; or &#8216;beryl&#8217;.
