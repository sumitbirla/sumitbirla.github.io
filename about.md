### History

I have had this website in one form or another since 1993 when the World Wide Web was still in its infancy. Initially, my pages were hosted on an FTP server at [University of South Florida](http://www.usf.edu/) where I my got bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s degrees. Eventually, an HTTP daemon was installed and I switched over to it. Sometime in 2001 or so, I bought the SumitBirla.com domain and transferred my pages to a commercial hosting service.
