Today I took my first step towards making this website [XHTML 1.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) compliant. XHTML is a stricter version of HTML conforming to XML specifications. The framework in which all content resides has already been validated. The [style sheet](http://sumit-old.tampahost.net/styles.css) is also valid. Updating each individual content page will take a while. While I am at it, I may also try to make the pages database driven so that future updates will be easier.
