I haven&#8217;t posted anything in a long time. So here is a summary update &#8211;

  * Bought a new [Lenovo 3000 N100](http://www.lenovo.com/) Laptop. The old desktop with it&#8217;s spaghetti wiring is history.
  * Had a week long vacation in [San Francisco](http://sumit-old.tampahost.net/photos/san-francisco) and surrounding areas.
  * Drove to [Saint Augustine](http://sumit-old.tampahost.net/photos/saint-augustine) for a weekend getaway
  * Started taking a grad class (Computer Networks) at USF
  * [Selling a bunch of stuff on eBay](http://shop.ebay.com/merchant/sumit_b_W0QQ_nkwZQQ_armrsZ1QQ_fromZQQ_mdoZ)
