In nature, &nbsp;bodies of water exist in a state of balance. &nbsp;You can jump into most lakes on Earth and not have to worry about pH being too low. &nbsp; However, a swimming pool is a closed system. &nbsp;It needs to be maintained via artificial methods. &nbsp;There is where a lot of stress can be introduced in your life. &nbsp;There are so many products available at pool stores that you simply don&#8217;t know what to get. &nbsp;You end up using recommendation of the salesperson or do a google search to receive a million different recommendations. &nbsp;Some problems that I have encountered:

  1. Why isn&#8217;t shock removing the green?
  2. Why is the water cloudy?
  3. Why is the pH so high?
  4. Why do I have difficulty telling what shade of purple is on the test strip?

After 5 years of living with a &nbsp;pool, &nbsp;I have narrowed down its maintenance to the following 5 rules. &nbsp;Before you do anything, you must have a pool test kit (not the strips, but the ones with the drops).

<img class="size-medium wp-image-301 aligncenter" title="Swimming Pool Test Kit" src="http://sumit.tampahost.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swimming-pool-test-kit-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://sumitbirla.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swimming-pool-test-kit-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sumitbirla.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swimming-pool-test-kit.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> 

## pH Level

_Ideal range: &nbsp;7.2 to 7.6_

You know what pH is from your high school classes, right? &nbsp; The trick to maintaining pH level is the use of two common chemicals:

**pH is too low (below 7.2)**: &nbsp; raise pH by adding Soda Ash aka Washing Soda. &nbsp;This is just Sodium Carbonate &#8211;&nbsp;Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. You can buy this in bulk at either pool store or hardware store. &nbsp;Broadcast it into the water.

**pH is too high (above 7.6):** &nbsp;lower pH by adding Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). &nbsp; It is sold as Muriatic Acid which is just 40% HCl, 60% water. &nbsp; Be careful with this one &#8211; don&#8217;t splash or inhale the fumes!

&nbsp;

## Total Alkalinity

_Ideal range: &nbsp;80 ppm to 120 ppm_  
[<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-300" title="Arm and Hammer - Baking Soda" src="http://sumit.tampahost.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Arm-and-Hammer-Bakign-Soda-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://sumitbirla.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Arm-and-Hammer-Bakign-Soda-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sumitbirla.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Arm-and-Hammer-Bakign-Soda.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />](http://sumit.tampahost.net/?attachment_id=300)  
This is the measure of total dissolved alkaline substances in the water. &nbsp;It has a stabilizing effect, i.e. it prevents wild swings in pH levels.

**TA is too low (below 80 ppm):** &nbsp;raise TA by broadcasting baking soda in the pool. &nbsp;Yes, your humble Sodium bicarbonate &#8211;&nbsp;NaHCO<sub>3</sub> will do the trick. You can buy a large bag of baking soda of the Arm and Hammer brand, if you&#8217;d like as they are easy to find.

**TA is too high (above 120 ppm):** &nbsp;well, this is tricky. &nbsp;I think you add acid until levels come down to 100 ppm. &nbsp;Please google this one!

&nbsp;

## Chlorine Level

_Ideal range: 1 ppm to 3 ppm_

Chlorine is what kills all those pesky microbes and algae in the water. &nbsp;In order for chlorine to work properly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is essential that pH and Total Alkalinity are in the correct range</span>. &nbsp;Otherwise you simply end up wasting money on Chlorine. &nbsp; &nbsp;For everyday use, I use the hockey puck size tablets &#8211; just drop a couple in the skimmer. &nbsp; If the pool shows signs of green, then you have to shock it which is essentially raising the Chlorine level to above 10 ppm. &nbsp;At these levels, pretty much any organic substance in the water is oxidized. &nbsp;I use liquid Chlorine. &nbsp;There are powdered varieties as well, but they include other ingredients which affect water chemistry in unknown (to me) ways. &nbsp; Always stick to simple chemistry!

&nbsp;

## Cyanuric Acid

_Ideal range: &nbsp;10 ppm to 50 ppm_

Cyanuraic acid is responsible for making sure that the chlorine does not dissipate too fast. &nbsp;This is often an ingredient in chlorine tablets and is known as stabilizer. &nbsp;Generally not an issue. &nbsp;However:

**Level is too low:** &nbsp;your chlorine in the water will dissipate too quickly in sunlight.

**Level is too high:** &nbsp;chlorine will be released too slowly and will be ineffective.

&nbsp;

## Summary

That&#8217;s all there is to pool maintenance. &nbsp; You may need a clarifier in case your pool gets cloudy, but use it only after addressing all the parameters above and that pool is algae free. &nbsp;Regular maintenance tips:

  1. Run pump 5-8 hours per day.
  2. Clean filters once a week.
  3. Test chemistry once a week and make adjustments as needed.
  4. Enjoy!
