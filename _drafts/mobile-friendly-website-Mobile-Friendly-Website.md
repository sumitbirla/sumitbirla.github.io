<img class="alignright" src="http://sumit-old.tampahost.net/images/iphone.jpg" alt="iPhone screenshot" width="120" height="210" />This website is now iPhone friendly, and possibly renders nicely on other phones as well. The changes involved the following:

  1. Mobile browser detection
  2. Hiding of the side menu and crumbtrail, replacing them with a menu across the top.
  3. Creation of a mobile stylesheet that removed unnecessary decorations.
  4. Making divs inline on pages with two columns of content so that the right column is rendered after the left.
  5. Specifying the viewport meta tag &#8211; 
    <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=600; initial-scale=0.53;" /&gt;</pre>

Fairly straightforward considering that this website already had a simple structure. Go ahead and trying opening this page on your phone. Leave me your comments.
