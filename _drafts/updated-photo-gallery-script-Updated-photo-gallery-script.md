Modified PHP script for generating online photo albums. The original script, called &#8216;Nail Cutter&#8217;, was written by [Thomas Weinert](http://www.subjective.de/). It is a simple yet effective program. You simply drop your photos in one folder and a browsable gallery is generated on the fly.
