Well almost &#8230; us Americans won&#8217;t get to watch it until 12 hours have passed since this historic event. Apparently, NBC has bought exclusive rights to broadcast the Olympics in the U.S. It has deemed it more important to air at a convenient time rather than have people watch it with the rest of the world. &#8220;One World One Dream,&#8221; eh?
