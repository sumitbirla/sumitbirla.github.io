Remember the time when your email resided on AOL, Prodigy or CompuServe and you could only send emails to people on the same sytem? That&#8217;s the state of affair with Instant Messaging sytems today. If you are on MSN, Yahoo or AIM, you can only send messages to people on the same network. But there is hope. Services such a Jabber and Google Talk are decentralized, federated systems which allow you to communicate with other domains. Essentially, someone on gmail.com can send an IM to a person on jabber.org. This is because they use the standardized protocol called [XMPP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp).

I have set up my own XMPP server now ([ejabberd](http://www.ejabberd.im/)). So my personal email address is also my IM contact ID. If you use one of growing list of XMPP-based services, you may add me to your contact list using my email address. Here is a [list of programs](http://xmpp.org/software/clients.shtml) which you can use to connect to XMPP based services. My personal favorite is [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/).
