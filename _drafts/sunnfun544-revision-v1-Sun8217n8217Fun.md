Or you could call it &#8216;too much sun&#8217; n fun! The City of Lakeland hosts this annual event where people from all over the country fly in. There are air-shows, experimental/commercial aircrafts on display and food (the whole spectrum starting from hot dogs and ending in corn dogs). I decided to check it out this year and got someÂ airshow pictures.
