On August 1st, _Newsworld International_ went off the air. Apparently, it was bought by a group headed by Al Gore which decided to convert into somethings called [Current TV](http://www.current.tv/).

This is a major disappointment. NWI was [CBC&#8217;s](http://www.cbc.ca/) sister channel and was probably the only channel broadcast in North America which provided broad perspectives on news stories. Some of the programs included _European Journal_ from Germany, _What&#8217;s on Japan?_, brief news summary from China, ITV from UK and _CBC Correspondent_from Canada. The documentaries such as _World Insight_ and _Special Assignment_ gave the audience context and historical perspective on current happenings. The presentation was designed to appeal to your thought and not your emotion (unlike most US counterparts).

Instead, now I am left with dumbed-down, MTV-style crap-!@#$&#8230;I mean Current TV and channels the likes of CNN, Fox, CBS and NBC where one is never sure where facts end and where opinions begin.
