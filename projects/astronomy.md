## Space: the final frontier

<img src="http://sumit-old.tampahost.net/images/nexstar5.jpg" alt="" align="right" /> Since I can&#8217;t leave the planet yet, the next best thing is to watch the skies from ground. The telescope on the right is what I intent to buy soon. It is an electronically controlled telescope with &#8220;go to&#8221; capability. The pictures below is what I should see (otherwise, I want my money back!)

**Some fun things to do**

  * Watch the International Space Station fly by
  * Scan the skies with binoculors
  * Whine about telescope prices!
